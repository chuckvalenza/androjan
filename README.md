Memeloader mimicks a legitimate program. From a compiled apk of Memeloader, we're going to insert a compiled version of DoEvil in smali. As a proof of concept, DoEvil downloads an image from a separate image server and saves it in a publicly writeable directory to prove access to both unauthorized networking functions and user-writeable storage.
